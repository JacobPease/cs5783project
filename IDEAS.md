## ML Paper Ideas

The table below contains a short list of papers we're considering peer reviewing and extending for this project.

| Paper (linked to source) | Publication | Citations | Code | How will we extend this paper? |
| ------------------------ | ----------- | --------- | ---- | ------------------------------ |
| [Model Soups](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/wortsman22a.html) | 39th PMLR (2022) | 700 | [github](https://github.com/mlfoundations/model-soups) | Apply the "model soups" method to another one of the papers below. For example, Latent Diffusion provides several pretrained models that we could mix together into a nice soup. |
| [Neural Acoustic Fields](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/151f4dfc71f025ae387e2d7a4ea1639b-Abstract-Conference.html) | NeurIPS 2022 | 57 | [github](https://github.com/aluo-x/Learning_Neural_Acoustic_Fields) | We could provide some alternative visualizations for this paper. Perhaps we could draw a subset of the acoustic field vectors, showing how sound interacts with corners and complex shapes. |
| [OpenAI Whisper (speech-to-text)](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/radford23a.html) | 40th PMLR (2023) | 2658 | [github](https://github.com/openai/whisper) | Model soup! |
| [Latent Diffusion (image synthesis)](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/html/Rombach_High-Resolution_Image_Synthesis_With_Latent_Diffusion_Models_CVPR_2022_paper.html) | CVPR 2022 | 10682 | [github](https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion) | Model soup! |
| [Unsupervised Fluid Dynamics Solver](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08762) | ICLR 2021 | 85 | [github](https://github.com/vc-bonn/Unsupervised_Deep_Learning_of_Incompressible_Fluid_Dynamics) | Use data generated by this fluid dynamics solver to work backwards: given an image of the fluid simulation, construct the vector field. Ideally we'd want to extend to 3d as well. |
